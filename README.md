# Big Data-powered Vietnamese Hate Speech Detection:A Kafka - Deep Learning Approach

## Abstract

In this research, we have developed a Kafka system to detect hate speech on live videos streamed on the YouTube platform. The system consists of two main components: offline and online. In the first component, we conducted experiments
with various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models using two datasets to identify the most effective model. In the online component, comments from the chat box of live YouTube videos are crawled, and the model predicts whether
each comment is classified as hate speech or clean. Subsequently, we label and evaluate these comments to improve the modelâ€™s performance, especially when it encounters misclassifications.
